# Program Function
This program will interact with the LTC6812 dev. board using SPI communication. 
It will print out the cell voltage values to the serial monitor. Currently it also includes basic GPIO 
manipulation but that still needs more work. 

# Future Work
* alter LTC68xx libraries to allow for two SPI channels
    -need to select between VSPI and HSPI on the ESP32 when sending commands
    -one channel will be used for each battery pack
* test I2C communication using GPIO pins for communication with MUXs


# Libraries
<LTC6812.h> Library used to interact with LTC6812 (often calls LTC681x.h)
<LTC681x.h> Library used to interact with generic LTC681x devices


# External Sources
<LTC6812.h> and <LTC681x.h> are taken from Analog Devices LINDUINO libraries:
https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/Linduino.git

Dev. Board Demo Code, includes examples for interacting with device:

May need external driver for ESP32:
